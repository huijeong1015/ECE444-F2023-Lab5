## What are the pros and cons of TDD?
### Pros:
The benefits of the test-driven development (TDD) are faster debugging, collaboration, and documentation. TDD speeds up debugging because failed tests pinpoint the problem. This also supports quicker problem resolution. Moreover, TDD fosters collaboration among test members. The test cases provide a medium for requirements, making it easier for the team to understand their development tasks and work with the code. Furthermore, TDD provides a space for documentation for the code. The test cases describe the expected behaviour of the code, which is valuable for the other developers who work on the project.
### Cons:
The disadvantages of TDD are incomplete test coverage, test management, overhead for simple tasks. The test cases created in the TDD cycle may not cover all the corner cases, depending on the developerâ€™s expertise. This will result in an incomplete test coverage. Moreover, test cases may need to be updated or rewritten to accommodate the change in requirements. This can be inefficient for the team. Furthermore, TDD can be an overkill for simple tasks or small code changes. Writing test cases in these cases can be time-consuming.
